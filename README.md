#### 3d ray tracing scene renderer
3d engine, which I did in the team project with three cool guys. The engine takes json with a scene and render it. The received shape can be configured for the presence of texture, its reflectivity, specularity, fill the shape with Perlin noise, and so on. You can also expose many different light sources, ability to control the number of bounces of rays. There is an opportunity to move around the stage.
The project was written according to the C coding standard.
Project has been tested on Mac OS.
